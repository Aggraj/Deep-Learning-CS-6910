The file CNN_scratch_fivelayers runs a sweep for parameter search for best possible model for iNaturalist dataset
The code does data augumentation and drop out also 

The file finetuning_pretrained helps in using the pretrained model for training for iNaturalist data set
4 different models are pre-trained models are used 'InceptionV3','InceptionResNetV2', 'ResNet50' and 'Xception'
